            <p className="mb-4">
              The Collaboration Hub is a feature of the Auvra Platform that allows users to work together on projects including shared workspaces, task management, and agreement tools. {/* [cite: 262] */} These Collaboration Hub Terms ("Hub Terms") supplement our main Terms of Service and apply whenever you use the Collaboration Hub. {/* [cite: 263] */}
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The Collaboration Hub is a tool, not a destination. You may use it to collaborate on projects that result in badges preserved on Auvra, projects that are completed entirely outside the Platform, or projects that never produce a badge at all. {/* [cite: 264] */}
            </p>
            <p>
              By using the Collaboration Hub, you agree to these Hub Terms. {/* [cite: 265] */} If there is a conflict between these Hub Terms and our main Terms of Service, these Hub Terms will govern your use of the Collaboration Hub. {/* [cite: 266] */}

            <h3 className="text-xl font-clash font-medium text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Eligibility and Verification</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              To use the Collaboration Hub, you must complete identity verification (KYC) to the level required by our AML/CFT Policy. {/* [cite: 268] */} Auvra will not grant access to the Collaboration Hub until verification is complete. {/* [cite: 269] */}
            </p>
            <p>
              Auvra reserves the right to suspend or revoke Collaboration Hub access if your verification status changes or if you are found to have provided false information. {/* [cite: 270] */}

            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>Define the scope and goals of the project {/* [cite: 273] */}</li>

              <li>Comply with the Community Guidelines and all other Auvra policies {/* [cite: 276] */}</li>

            <p className="mb-4">You may invite any verified Auvra user to join a collaboration. Invitations may be accepted or declined. {/* [cite: 277] */}</p>
            <p>Collaborations may be for cultural works, commercial projects, community initiatives, educational content, or any other lawful purpose. {/* [cite: 278] */} The Collaboration Hub does not require that the final work be preserved on Auvra or anywhere else. {/* [cite: 279] */}</p>

            <p className="mb-4">Before any work begins, collaborators may agree on (but are not required to): {/* [cite: 281] */}</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li><strong>Ownership splits</strong> - the percentage of the final work owned by each collaborator {/* [cite: 282] */}</li>

            <p>If you choose to record these terms in the Collaboration Hub, they become binding once all collaborators have accepted them. {/* [cite: 284] */} If you do not use these tools, you are solely responsible for your own agreements. {/* [cite: 285] */}</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-clash font-medium text-gray-900 mb-4">5. Locking the Agreement</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">If you record ownership, revenue, or usage terms in the Collaboration Hub, the agreement becomes locked once all collaborators have accepted it. {/* [cite: 287] */} Locked terms cannot be changed except by unanimous consent of all collaborators, and any such change will be recorded as an amendment. {/* [cite: 288] */}</p>
            <p>Locking the agreement is only required if you want Auvra to automatically distribute revenue from badge sales. {/* [cite: 289] */} If your project never involves an Auvra badge sale, locking is optional. {/* [cite: 290] */}</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-clash font-medium text-gray-900 mb-4">6. Revenue Distribution (Only If Applicable)</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">If your collaboration results in a badge sale on Auvra, and you have locked a revenue split in the Collaboration Hub, Auvra will distribute proceeds according to that split. {/* [cite: 292] */} Distributions are made in USDC to each collaborator's Auvra wallet. {/* [cite: 293] */}</p>
            <p className="mb-4">If a collaborator has not completed KYC or cannot receive USDC (e.g., due to sanctions, platform restrictions, or unverified status), Auvra will hold their share of the proceeds until they become eligible. {/* [cite: 294] */} If eligibility is not established within a reasonable time (e.g., 12 months), the funds may be donated to a cultural preservation cause at Auvra's discretion, after reasonable attempts to contact the collaborator. {/* [cite: 295] */}</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Auvra deducts any applicable transaction fees (as described in our main Terms of Service) before distribution. {/* [cite: 296] */}</p>
            <p>If your project does not involve a badge sale on Auvra, this section does not apply. {/* [cite: 297] */} Auvra has no role in any payments made outside the Platform. {/* [cite: 298] */}</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-clash font-medium text-gray-900 mb-4">7. Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">Disputes arising from a collaboration (e.g., ownership, attribution, revenue, or breach of any agreement) shall first be resolved through good faith negotiations among the collaborators. {/* [cite: 300] */} If the dispute cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days, it may be submitted to the dispute resolution process described in Section 11 of our main Terms of Service (Governing Law & Dispute Resolution). {/* [cite: 301] */}</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Auvra does not arbitrate or mediate disputes. We provide the tools for collaboration but are not a party to your agreements. {/* [cite: 302] */}</p>
            <p>The term "community governance mechanisms" refers to informal processes that communities may choose to adopt (e.g., elder review, consensus voting), but these are not provided or enforced by Auvra. {/* [cite: 303] */}</p>

            <p className="mb-4">Any collaborator may leave a collaboration at any time. Leaving does not cancel obligations already accepted (e.g., ownership or revenue commitments for work already completed). {/* [cite: 306] */} Leaving does not affect ownership or revenue rights for work completed before departure, unless your locked agreement provides otherwise. {/* [cite: 307] */}</p>
            
            <h4 className="font-medium text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">Termination by Auvra</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">Auvra may suspend or terminate access to the Collaboration Hub if a user violates these Hub Terms, the main Terms of Service, or the Community Guidelines. {/* [cite: 309] */} Termination of access does not affect ownership rights in already-completed work. {/* [cite: 310] */}</p>
            
            <h4 className="font-medium text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">Completion or abandonment</h4>
            <p>Collaborations may be marked as completed by unanimous consent, or as abandoned after six consecutive months of inactivity. {/* [cite: 312] */} "Inactivity" means no logins, file uploads, messages, or other actions by any collaborator within that period. {/* [cite: 313] */} Auvra reserves the right to close abandoned collaborations after providing 30 days' notice to the collaborators' registered email addresses. {/* [cite: 314] */}</p>
