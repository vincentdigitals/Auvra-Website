            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>How to Exercise Your Rights:</strong> To exercise your rights, contact us at info@goauvra.com. We will respond within 30 days (extendable by 60 days for complex requests, with notice).</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>Deletion & Blockchain Records:</strong> Because blockchain records are immutable, on-chain badge data cannot be deleted. If you request deletion, we will remove off-chain content and personal information where possible, but on-chain badge records will remain as part of the public cultural archive. We will not associate them with your identity after deletion. Private vault content can be deleted by you at any time.</p>
            <p><strong>Escalation:</strong> If you are not satisfied with our response, you may escalate to your local supervisory authority (e.g., Nigeria Data Protection Commission, UK ICO, or your country's data protection authority).</p>
